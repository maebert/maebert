# Hi there, I'm [Manu](https://www.x.com/maebert).  

Technologist, entrepreneur, nomad. Iâ€™ve been helping companies bring machine learning and AI to the public for over 12 years. You might know me as the author of [jrnl](https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl) and the infamous [Most Dangerous Writing App](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp) (and it's spiritual successor, [The Least Dangerous To-Do List](https://theleastdangeroustodolist.com/). I'm the Founder of [Hyperspell](https://www.github.com/hyperspell), where I'm helping companies build AI products by making it easy, safe and reliable for people and business to connect their data and apps (we're hiring)

I spent the last decade helping companies bring [machine learning to their products](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/technology/scouring-the-web-to-make-new-words-lookupable.html?_r=0), and building teams driven by empathy and purpose.


Occasionally, I write about things that matter to me. You might enjoy:
